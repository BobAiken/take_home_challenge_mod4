# [Take Home Challenge Mod 4](https://take-home-challenge-mod4.vercel.app/)

## Overview
This application was built as a simiulation of a take home challenge that an interviewer might give. It was assigned on a Tuesday, initial feedback was given on thursday, and a final presentation of the application was performed on friday. Overall, the project was worked on for less than 8 hours.

The application itself displays the top articles from the NY times which can be sorted by category. Clicking on an article takes you to a more detailed view which can link to the real article on the NY Times website.
